    "name": "Mock Server Scope Clarification",
    "description": "This feature seeks to clarify the project scope for the Mock Server. It addresses whether the server should support additional protocols (e.g., SOAP, WebSockets) alongside RESTful APIs, identifies the preferred technology stack (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java), and outlines any necessary integration requirements, such as CI/CD pipeline compatibility and load testing support.",
    "userStory": "As a project stakeholder, I want to confirm the scope and technology requirements of the mock server so that the final design and implementation meet our development, testing, and integration needs.",
    "acceptanceCriteria": "1. Confirm whether the mock server should only handle RESTful APIs or also include support for protocols like SOAP and WebSockets.\n2. Identify the preferred technology stack for implementation (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.).\n3. List integration requirements, such as compatibility with CI/CD pipelines and load testing tools, if any.",
    "diagram": "",
    "additional": "Clarification on these points is essential to ensure that the subsequent design and development phases align with stakeholder expectations and integration environments. This will guide technology selection and architecture decisions.",
    "prompt": "Please provide additional details on the following points: \n1. Should the mock server focus solely on simulating RESTful APIs, or is there a need to support other protocols like SOAP and WebSockets?\n2. What is the preferred technology stack for implementing the mock server (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask/Django, or Java with Spring Boot)?\n3. Are there any specific integration requirements, such as compatibility with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) or load testing tools, that we need to consider?",
    "code": "",
    "notes": "These clarifications will enhance the project requirements document and ensure that the solution is aligned with the target use cases and infrastructure requirements.",
