    "name": "Data Persistence",
    "description": "Enables stateful behavior by persisting data across requests, simulating a database environment for testing purposes.",
    "userStory": "As a tester, I want the mock server to maintain state across multiple requests so that I can simulate database operations.",
    "acceptanceCriteria": "The mock server must maintain session state and simulate CRUD operations, returning consistent data across requests.",
    "diagram": "Diagram showing stateful interactions with a simulated database within the mock server architecture.",
    "additional": "Include options for simulating both transient and durable storage based on the testing scenario.",
    "prompt": "Develop a feature that adds data persistence to the mock server. It should be able to maintain state across multiple requests, simulating database-like CRUD operations.",
    "code": "// Pseudo-code for maintaining state:\n// state = {}; \n// function updateState(key, value) { state[key] = value; }",
    "notes": "Consider performance overhead and use caching strategies if needed.",
