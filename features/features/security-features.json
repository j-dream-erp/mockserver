    "description": "Implements features like authentication, authorization, and rate limiting to simulate secure environments and test API security.",
    "userStory": "As a security tester, I want the mock server to enforce authentication, authorization, and rate limiting, so that I can validate client behavior under secure conditions.",
    "acceptanceCriteria": "The mock server must enforce security protocols such as OAuth, API key verification, and rate limiting based on request thresholds.",
    "diagram": "Diagram showing the security layers implemented within the mock server architecture.",
    "additional": "Security configurations should be easily adjustable to test different scenarios and potential vulnerabilities.",
    "prompt": "Add security features to the mock server including authentication, authorization, and rate limiting. The system should enforce these security measures to simulate a secure API environment.",
    "code": "// Pseudo-code for API key authentication:\n// if(request.apiKey !== expectedKey) { throw new UnauthorizedError(); }",
    "notes": "Ensure that security measures can be toggled for different testing scenarios.",
