  "feature": "Dynamic Response Generation",
  "featureSchema": {
    "name": "Dynamic Response Generation",
    "description": "Generates responses based on incoming request parameters, headers or body content, and can randomly create test data to simulate different scenarios.",
    "userStory": "As a developer, I want the mock server to generate dynamic responses so that I can simulate various API behaviors based on different input conditions.",
    "acceptanceCriteria": "The mock server must evaluate incoming request parameters and conditions to provide conditional and randomized responses as defined in the configuration.",
    "diagram": "Diagram showing request input branching into conditional logic with corresponding dynamic responses.",
    "additional": "Supports conditional responses based on parameters, headers, and body content along with random data generation for stress testing.",
    "prompt": "Develop a feature that analyzes incoming request details such as parameters, headers, and body content to generate a dynamic response. The response should be configurable to return different outputs or random data under specific conditions.",
    "code": "// Example pseudo-code:\n// if(request.param == 'test') {\n//    return generateRandomResponse();\n// } else {\n//    return standardResponse();\n// }",
    "notes": "Ensure the feature is easily extendable to include more complex logic if required.",
